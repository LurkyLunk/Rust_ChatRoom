# # Rust Chatroom

## Overview

Rust Chatroom is a simple, real-time chat application built in Rust. It utilizes asynchronous programming to handle multiple connections efficiently and provides a basic framework for real-time messaging between clients. This project is designed to demonstrate the core concepts of network programming and asynchronous I/O in Rust.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Allows multiple clients to send and receive messages in real-time.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Uses Rust's async/await syntax for handling multiple connections concurrently.
- **Simple Protocol**: A straightforward protocol for sending and receiving messages.
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for both the server and client.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
